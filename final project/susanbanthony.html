        <b>Susan B. Anthony</b> was born on February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. Susan, an American writer, abolitionist, and women's rights activist, was a leading figure in women's the voting rights movement.</p>
        <br/>
    <p>In 1851, Susan met <!--this is a link to a website--><a href="https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizabeth-cady-stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a> at an anti-slavery conference. The next year, the two established the New York  State Temperance Society, and later published <a href="https://www.accessible-archives.com/collections/the-revolution/"><i>The Revolution</i></a>, which was a weekly publication that lobbied for women's rights. The newspaper's motto was "Men their rights, and nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less." In 1869, Anthony and Stanton founded the <!--this is a link to a website--><a href="http://www.crusadeforthevote.org/nwsa-organize/">National Woman Suffrage Association</a> . Susan B. Anthony was determined in her efforts, giving speeches around the country to help convince more women to vote. She even took drastic measures and voted illegally in the presidential election in 1872, getting herself arrested for the crime. <!--this is a picture of wome protesting-->

In 1905, she met with President Theodore Roosevelt to lobby for an  amendment to give women the right to vote.
    <br/>
    <p>Anthony passed away in 1906, but thanks to her tremendous efforts, the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/19th-amendment-1">19th Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution was passed in 1920, giving all adult women the right to vote.
